  <p class="body">MotorMaster is a cross-platform interface that allows for effective communication throughout the car repair process. This service gives teachers and students the time they require, but still keep clients updated daily on their car’s progress.
  <br><br> Teachers!<br>
MotorMaster gives you an easy and convenient way to manage their clients and students! You can assign specific students to clients that require car repair with a simple scroll and click. The way you would assign in real life is simplified through this service. Mandatory forms, including all the automotive repair intake forms, can be filled in digitally without the hassle of mailing or faxing the form to the client. This service makes it mandatory that student updates are first checked by you before being sent to clients!
<br><br>Students!<br>
